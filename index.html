You need to tell them what SPECIFICALLY gets you excited about THEIR work. What problems would you actually enjoy solving for them? Not just 'I'm well motivated.' That's like saying 'I have a personality.' Prove it.",
                    "Motivation, yeah. Thing is, you can't just say you're motivated and expect them to believe you - that's like me walking into a room and announcing 'I'm funny' before I've even told a joke. You need to explain what specifically interests you about what THEY do. What aspect of their work makes you think 'yeah, I want to get stuck into that'? Be specific, not generic.",
                    "Alright, motivation. Here's the thing - and I learned this from management training - generic motivation is like cheap cologne, everyone can smell it's not the real thing. 63% of employers say being clear about your motivation is THE most important advice. Tell them exactly what about their role excites you. What would you be doing day-to-day that makes you think 'yes, that's the kind of problem I want to solve'?"

You've mentioned you're interested, but drill down. What EXACTLY about their work gets you going? They want to know you've thought about what you'd actually be doing for them, not just that you want A job.",
                    "Not bad, not bad. You've got some motivation in there, but it's still a bit generic, yeah? It's like when I tell people I'm into music - okay, but what kind? Same here. What specifically about THEIR problems interests you? What would you be working on that makes you think 'I could really get into that'? Make it more concrete.",
                    "Decent start on motivation, but remember - 68% of employers say good motivation can outweigh missing experience. That's massive. So don't waste it on vague statements.

You've done the research, you know what they do, and you've explained what about it appeals to you. Keep that energy.",

Make it obvious.",

If they ask for 'project management experience,' use those exact words when describing what you've done.",
                    "Decent job ad matching, but you could be more direct about it. It's like when I reference my management qualifications - I don't hint at them, I state them clearly. If the job ad mentions specific skills or experience they need, mirror that language in your application. Make the connection impossible to miss.",

                            Welcome to your personal job application quality checker,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's how it works: Write your application in Word, paste a section here,
                            and honestly evaluate it against five key criteria.
                            Then get feedback that's both hilarious and genuinely helpful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The self-evaluation is the secret - it forces you to think critically
                            about your writing rather than just accepting whatever comes out.
                            And David makes it fun enough that you'll actually do it.
