# The Brent Companion

A web-based job application quality checker inspired by David Brent from The Office UK.

## What is this?

The Brent Companion helps you maintain focus and quality while writing job applications by providing humorous feedback based on established best practices. You write in Microsoft Word, paste sections into the web app for self-evaluation, and receive character-driven commentary that makes quality-checking actually enjoyable.

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Write your job application in Microsoft Word
3. Paste sections (like your motivation paragraph or STAR examples) into the companion
4. Self-evaluate against five key criteria
5. Receive feedback from David Brent
6. Return to Word and revise based on insights
